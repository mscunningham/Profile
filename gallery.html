          <h4> Ink Illustration colored in Photoshop </h4> <p> This was an illustration project from Word & Image II during the fall of Junior year. We were given a list of nursery rhymes to recreate. This was an exploration of character, motion, and narrative. </p><p> These three images illustrate Little Nancy Etticoat, Simple Simon Met a Pieman, and Pussy Cat Pussy Cat Where Have You Been? </p><p> Little Nancy Etticoat is about a melting candle. I was drawn to the quiet moment of realization of her fate. Simple Simon provided a rediculous interaction with a huge pieman who keep his pies from being ruined. Finally, Pussy Cat Pussy Cat pushed me to explore animalistic expression and contortion. </p>

          <h2>Bad Day for a Waitress</h2>
          <div class="col-md-4">
          
          <h4> Ink and Guache combined in Photoshop </h4> <p> Word & Image I final during the spring of Sophomore year. Assigned "Bad Day for a Waitress" as a topic to explore. The challenge was in creating a narrative character in action. </p>
          <p> First we researched how others have solved this problem of character, space, and narrative. We looked at the works of Lowell Hess, Rea Irvin, and Harry Beckhoff in early to mid 20th century in a visit to WashU's West Campus. 
          <p> Armed with some reference knowledge, I began skeching. I gravitated towards the idea of a waitress who has too much to carry.  Her struggled posture is dynamic and engaging. Her surroundings melt away as her attention is focused on not dropping this mass of plates and dishes she has to carry.</p>
          <p> We were allowed to use black and one other color to describe our character. I used the most saturated version of my red in the legs and hair to draw attention to those key points.</p>

  <h2>Collections Poster: Gaze</h2>
          <div class="col-md-4">
          
          <h4> India Ink and InDesign </h4> <p> Word & Image I project during the spring of Sophomore year. We were each given a topic from which to generate a collection of 8 to 20 items. I explored the collection of "Stargazing and the Constellations." First I was interested in exploring cross cultural and cross temporal views of the night sky. I was attached to different types of windows. After weeks of this approach focused more on the windows and the culture rather than the sky, I had to change my strategy</p>
          <p> When I found myself stuck starting over I grabbed my india ink and some brushes. I made some textures and strokes and scanned them at a very high resolution. I combined the effects I got from the ink in photoshop to get night sky characteristics. All of the items I represented were visible in the night sky without any equipment. </p>
          <p> There is a connection between the lack of technology required in seeing these phenomena and the use of the physical texture of the ink media.</p>
          <p> The collection is arranged in a verticle arrangement. The galaxy is the isolated on the left both because it was a more detailed exploration and also because of it's importance. It was challenging to create a way to add a caption to an isolated image but I found a way to connect the two in calling out the (Left) position.
          <p> This poster aims to educate the viewer on what sorts of things they can see in the nightsky without requiring any expensive technology. <p>

          <div class="col-md-4">
         <h4> Type I Final: Typeface Book </h4> <p> For our final in Type I spring of Sophomore year, we were each allowed to choose from a list of typefaces to research. We were then asked ot create a grid system to most effectively explain the history, function, and characteristics of the typeface. The challenge was in creating descriptive diagrams while maintainig a clear system. </p><p>I chose a landscape orientation and a three column system. There is a conistent treatment of the callouts and sidenotes. This is an expression of our understanding of type conventions. </p>
         <p> The fuction of this book is primarly education through diagrams. I used contrast with color and scale shift as well as comparisons to shw the unique features of Frutiger's Univers typeface.
